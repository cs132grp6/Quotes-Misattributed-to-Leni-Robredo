<h1><strong>DATA EXPLORATION</strong></h1>
						
<hr>



<h2 style="text-align:left;">Data Collection</h2>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left;">
The data was collected using the Apify Twitter Web Scraper [link]. The scraper was configured to return at most 1000 tweets from at most 1000 accounts each. Scraping was performed in the middle of March, with the primary selection criteria being keywords related to known pieces of misinformation (i.e. misleading and/or incorrect quotes) related to Leni Robredoâ€™s campaign. 152 tweets were collected after verifying their contents.

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left;"> 
Data was already preprocessed to follow a consistent formatting during data gathering. 
<br>

<ol style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:21px;">
<li>Unnecessary columns and features (e.g. account ID, profile picture URL, etc.) returned by the scraper were deleted manually using a Python script.</li>
<li>Date strings were re-formatted from YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.XXXXZ to follow the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, which were then preprocessed further to a pandas Datetime type.</li>

<ul style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:21px; padding:25; margin:5;">
<li> Date String Before Reformatting:</li>
<img src="images/before.png" alt="" width="500"></img>
<br>
<br>
<li> Date String After Reformatting:</li>
<img src="images/after.png" alt="" width="500"></img>
<br>
</ul>

<li>Among the required fields, only Account bio and Location had blank values. Blank values on these fields were allowed, since these features are not needed for the problem.</li>
<li>The categorical fields Account type, Content type, and Tweet Type were hot encoded.</li>
<br>

<ul style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:21px; padding:25; margin:5;">
<li> Sample Encoding of Account Type:</li>
<img src="images/Sample_Account type.png" alt="" width="500"></img>
<br>
<br>
<li> Sample Encoding of Content Type:</li>
<img src="images/Sample_Content type.png" alt="" width="500"></img>
<br>
<br>
<li> Sample Encoding of Tweet Type:</li>

</ul>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Features Distribution</h2>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left;"> 
The following features are <b>skewed towards the lower end</b>:
<ul style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:21px; padding:25; margin:5;">

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Time Series Exploration</h2>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left;"> 

<b>Hourly Frequency</b> <br>
The hourly frequency graph shows us that it is more likely for a collected tweet to be posted from noon to midnight (note that in the exploration below, "7am to 12pm" means "7:00 am to 12:59 pm")
<br>
<br>

<b>Daily/Weekly Frequency</b> <br>
The daily frequency graph shows us that it is more likely for a collected tweet to be posted on the 8th to 15th days of the month, as well as on the 25th to 31st day of the month.
Meanwhile, analyzing which day of the week a tweet was posted shows us that it is most likely for a tweet to be posted on a Thursday. It is also interesting that it is almost equally likely for a tweet to be posted from Monday to Wednesday and Friday to Sunday.
<br>
<br>

<b>Monthly Frequency</b> <br>
Looking purely at the months when the tweets were posted, most of them were posted in either May or October. Combining these with the year of posting provides some more insight: tweets appear to spike in October 2021, April 2022 and May 2022. These months coincide with the following events: October 2021 was when certificates of candidacy were filed, while April and May 2022 was during the last moments of election campaign season.

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Features Comparison</h2>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left;"> 
Despite more tweets being posted on certain hours or days, this does not necessarily translate to more engagement to the tweets.
<br><br>
The first boxplot compares the number of likes of tweets <b>posted before noon (<12 nn) versus after noon (>=12 nn)</b> (dots represent outliers). On the other hand, the second boxplot compares the number of likes of tweets <b>posted on a weekday (Monday to Friday) or on a weekend (Saturday, Sunday)</b>. 
<br><br>
In either boxplot, there is <b>no difference in the number of likes between groups</b>.
<br><br>

<!--Before and after noon-->
