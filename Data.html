<h1><strong>DATA EXPLORATION</strong></h1>
						
<hr>



<h2 style="text-align:left;">Data Collection</h2>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left;">
The data was collected using the Apify actor <a href="https://apify.com/quacker/twitter-scraper">Twitter Scraper</a>. The scraper was configured to return at most 1000 tweets from at most 1000 accounts each. Scraping was performed in the middle of March, 2023, with the primary selection criteria being keywords related to known pieces of misinformation (i.e. misleading and/or incorrect quotes) related to Leni Robredoâ€™s campaign. <b>152 tweets</b> were collected after verifying their contents.
<br><br>
<b>Search Keyword Distribution. </b> The distribution of tweets based on search keywords used is as follows:

<b>Data Features. </b> For this study, the relevant data features are:
</p>
<ul style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:21px; padding-left:75px;">
<li>Date posted</li>
<li>Number of likes</li>
<li>Number of retweets</li>
</ul>

					
<hr>
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left;"> 
Data was already preprocessed to follow a consistent formatting during data gathering. 
<br>
<br>

<ol style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:21px;">

<li><b>Ensuring formatting consistency</b></li>
<p> 
Unnecessary columns and features (e.g. account ID, profile picture URL, etc.) returned by the scraper were deleted manually using a Python script.</li>
Date strings from the scraper were re-formatted from YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.XXXXZ to follow the format DD/MM/YY HH:MM, which were then preprocessed further to a pandas Datetime type with format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
</p>

<ul style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:21px; padding-left:75px;">
<li> Date String Before Reformatting:</li>
<img src="images/Sample_Raw.png" alt="" width="1100"></img>
<br>
<br>
<li> Date String After Reformatting:</li>
<img src="images/Sample_Formatted.png" alt="" width="700"></img>
<br>
</ul>

<li><b>Ensuring no missing values</b></li>
<p>
Among the required fields, only Account bio and Location had blank values. Blank values on these fields were allowed, since these features are not needed for the problem.
</p>

<li><b>One-hot encoding</b></li>
<p>
The categorical fields Account type, Content type, and Tweet Type were hot encoded.
</p>

<ul style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:21px; padding-left:75px;">
<li> Sample Encoding of Account Type:</li>
<img src="images/Sample_Account type.png" alt="" width="500"></img>
<br>
<br>
<li> Sample Encoding of Content Type:</li>
<img src="images/Sample_Content type.png" alt="" width="500"></img>
<br>
<br>
<li> Sample Encoding of Tweet Type:</li>
<img src="images/Sample_Tweet type.png" alt="" width="700"></img>
</ul>

<li><b>Outlier handling</b></li>
<p> 
Due to one of the hypotheses focusing on engagement, engagement columns (Followers, Likes, Replies, Retweets) were the ones primarily handled for outliers. Outliers were located using the Interquartile Range method, with outliers being values below 1st Quartile - 1.5IQRs and above 3rd Quartile + 1.5IQRs, with one IQR representing the range between the 3rd and 1st Quartiles. For each feature, there were 20, 19, 5, and 26 outliers respectively. There, however, were only 3 tweets that are considered outliers for all features. To preserve data, only these 3 tweets were removed, leaving 149 tweets.
</p>

<li><b>Binning (monthly)</b></li>
<p>
The Date posted was binned into month and year. The Monthly Frequency section shows the insights gained from binning the Date posted feature this way.
</p>
</ol>
<br>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Features Distribution</h2>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left;"> 
The following features are <b>skewed towards the lower end</b>:
<ul style="color:black; text-align:left; font-size:21px; padding-left:75px;">
<li> Following (0-499) </li>
<li> Followers (0-990) </li>
<li> Likes (0-9) </li>
<li> Replies (0-4) </li>
<li> Retweets (0-1) </li>
</ul>

<b>Daily/Weekly Frequency</b> <br>
The daily frequency graph shows us that it is more likely for a collected tweet to be posted on the 8th to 15th days of the month, as well as on the 25th to 31st day of the month.
Meanwhile, analyzing which day of the week a tweet was posted shows us that it is most likely for a tweet to be posted on a Thursday. It is also interesting that it is almost equally likely for a tweet to be posted from Monday to Wednesday and Friday to Sunday.

<b>Monthly Frequency</b> <br>
Looking purely at the months when the tweets were posted, most of them were posted in either May or October. Combining these with the year of posting provides some more insight: tweets appear to <b>spike in October 2021, April 2022 and May 2022</b>. These months coincide with the following events: October 2021 was when certificates of candidacy were filed, while April and May 2022 was during the last moments of election campaign season.

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Features Comparison</h2>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left;"> 
Despite more tweets being posted on certain hours or days, this does not necessarily translate to more engagement to the tweets.
<br><br>
The first boxplot compares the number of likes of tweets <b>posted before noon (<12 nn) versus after noon (>=12 nn)</b> (dots represent outliers). On the other hand, the second boxplot compares the number of likes of tweets <b>posted on a weekday (Monday to Friday) or on a weekend (Saturday, Sunday)</b>. 
<br><br>
In either boxplot, there is <b>no difference in the number of likes between groups</b>.
<br><br>

<!--Before and after noon-->
